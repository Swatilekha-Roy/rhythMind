# rhythMind
A web app that plays music according to your emotional needs and helps you recharge your mental health with an altogether new and different listening experience.

## Technologies Used
We utilized various technologies ranging from animation tools, web development tools, scripting languages and multiple APIs to build ‘rythMind’. 
- Front end languages: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, AJAX
- Front end framework: Bootstrap to design the user interface (UI)
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Spotify API: To fetch and manage the relevant catalogs about artists, tracks and playlists  
- Pexels API: To fetch images corresponding to the emotions displayed on our web app presently 
- Microsoft Azure: To create a conversational, friendly echo chatbot for rythMind which engages in a friendly conversation with the user helping him/her/them talk about their emotions and guiding them towards a calming experience by suggesting relevant songs, playlists, meditation or breathing exercises.

## What it Does
It provides a well earned respite and relief to the tired mind and soul through music and a variety of proven meditative reliefs and stress busting techniques to anybody who is stressed out or feeling negative about something. We have also tried to make an immersive listening experience with soothing landscapes and build up situational stories that are meant to release stress and feel transformative. There is also a friendly bot to answer your questions and a blog section featuring related music therapy articles.
