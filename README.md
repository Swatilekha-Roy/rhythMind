# [rhythMind](https://github.com/Swatilekha-Roy/rhythMind)
A web app that plays music according to your emotional needs and helps you recharge your mental health with an altogether new and different listening experience.

## What it Does
It provides a well earned respite and relief to the tired mind and soul through music and a variety of proven meditative reliefs and stress busting techniques to anybody who is stressed out or feeling negative about something. We have also tried to make an immersive listening experience with soothing landscapes and build up situational stories that are meant to release stress and feel transformative. There is also a friendly bot to answer your questions and a blog section featuring related music therapy articles.
